Greetings fellow BACnet enthusiasts!

After months of development, we are finally ready to release a new
major version of Wacnet.

You can download it here:
[Download Wacnet](https://hvac.io/docs/wacnet).

The underlying engine [bacure](https://github.com/Frozenlock/bacure)
has been heavily reworked to enable easier programming and interfacing
with the network.


## Explorer

The *Explorer* is still available to explore your BACnet network and
the interface remains mostly unchanged.

One nice little addition : it will now automatically refresh the
*present values* of all the objects you are currently looking at after
a short delay.


### Create and Delete Remote Objects

Using the *Explorer*, you can now create new BACnet objects in remote devices.
Inversely, you can also delete objects.

## API

This is where things get **really** interesting.

We took what we learned in [Vigilia](https://hvac.io/services/vigilia)
and built an amazing web API.

This means that whenever you have Wacnet running on a BACnet network,
you can send HTTP request to read data or send commands. You can now
built your own BACnet applications and use this API directly without
the need to learn Clojure!

Imagine building beautiful dashboards in HTML and javascript. Just
fetch the data directly on the WACnet API and show amazing stuff on
your creation.

You can check our
[small example](http://blog.hvac.io/2015/10/20/fun-with-vigilias-api)
for the Vigilia API if you need some inspiration.
