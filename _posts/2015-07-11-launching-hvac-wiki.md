We are happy to announce the launch of
[HVAC wiki](https://wiki.hvac.io). The aim of this wiki is to
accumulate and make available information about everything related to
HVAC.

[HVAC wiki](https://wiki.hvac.io) will be a place for documentations,
manuals, debugging techniques, installation instructions, rules of
thumb... in short, everything that could help professionnals in their
day-to-day job.

It must be made abundantly clear this wiki is not intended to replace
Wikipedia. Instead, what we hope to accomplish with your help is a
place for everyone to share information that might otherwise be
considered 'noise' in other places.


# Why?

Because the *status quo* sucks.

Most of the knowledge in HVAC is oral tradition.

Besides the basic mathematical equations, you can't easily find
anything you are looking for. It's all slowly learned by meeting
senior professionals who can give you tips they learned the hard way.

Documentations from vendors are often minimal, or even purposely
lacking in critical information: "For the MetasysSysAgent default
password, contact your local Johnson ControlsÂ® representative."

The small portion of knowledge available online is scattered all over
the place in articles, PDFs, and remote forums, making sure that they
will never be updated.

It doesn't have to be this way.

It's up to us to change the situation.

## How to Know What to Contribute

It's really simple: would that have helped you in one of your task? If
the answer is yes, then you should add it!

It can be **anything**:
- Typical pipe dimension for a given task;
- Preferred type of glue;
- Controls tricks to deal with those pesky electric heaters;
- How to use Wireshark when the BACnet port is NOT 47808;

We mean it: anything somewhat related to HVAC is welcome.

### Leave notes for yourself!

I personally can't remember how many times I've gone through the pain
of debugging a system, and say to myself "Bah, I'll never encounter
this type of system again"... WRONG! If only I had some notes from my
previous adventures.

Let's say you encounter a problem with a software on a particular
version of Windows. Hopefully you'll find to a way to fix this. Well,
this 'fix' is the kind of info HVAC wiki is for.

Feels familiar?

Don't worry about formatting. You, or anyone else, can always come
back later and fix that. If you are in the heat of the moment, just
leave some quick notes.

The cherry on top: the wiki's URL is super easy to remember!

## Documentation as Living Documents

We, at [HVAC.IO](https://hvac.io), are going to move all our
documentation into the wiki. This way, if some users think there's
some missing info, they are free to add it. (As a bonus, it's also
**very** easy to modify documents in a jiffy if we forgot something.)

We invite everyone to do the same thing.

Hopefully, we'll be able to change the HVAC landscape.
