Howdy folks,

We just released a new version of Wacnet.

You can download it here:
[Download Wacnet](https://hvac.io/docs/wacnet). If you are on the
mailing list, you should already have received a direct download link.

This release focuses on usability. You can now start the application
by double-clicking on the jar file. Yay!

## Bugs Fixes

We fixed a bug that caused the Explorer to 'explode'. It would simply
stop showing the list of devices. The BACnet engine was still working
fine, (you could still use the REPL) but a Javascript detail was
messing everything up in the Eplorer tab.


## New Additions

### System Tray Icon

While the best way to keep control over the application is still to
start it via the command line, you can now close it via the system
tray. Useful for when you started the application by double clicking
on the jar...

### Splash Screen

Now that running the application with a double-click is viable, we
must let the user know when the application is starting. A splash
screen will do just that.


### Port Already Taken Error Message

This is one of these things that is obvious for everyone with some
knowledge in the field, but absolutely confusing to everyone else. A
port cannot be taken by two application at the same time. If one was
to try to run Wacnet with another software already connected to the
BACnet network, he would get a somewhat cryptic message like this one:

    Exception in thread "main" java.net.BindException: Address already in use (...)

We now make sure to let you know what's happening and what you should
do to solve the problem:

As usual, don't hesitate to contact us if you have any suggestion or
bug to report.
