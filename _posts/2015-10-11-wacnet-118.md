It is yet again the time for a new Wacnet release.

You can download it here:
[Download Wacnet](https://hvac.io/docs/wacnet). If you are on the
mailing list, you should already have received a direct download link.




## New Features

This release introduces a few new features...



### HVAC Wiki Link - Manufacturer and Model Info

Not only is Wacnet now able to show you the device manufacturer and model, it does so by generating a link to the [HVAC Wiki](https://wiki.hvac.io).

This means that while your are exploring a BACnet network, you can jump immediately to the device's wiki entry.

An unknown device? Check who made it... A problem with a particular
device? Check its wiki entry for known bugs!

### Configurable Caching

Since 1.1.6, Wacnet has been caching the remote devices properties for
a few minutes. While it can dramatically speed up browsing on a slow network,
sometimes you might prefer to have a VERY recent property value.

With this release, users are now able to configure the caching
time (or disable it altogether).

### Vigilia Self-hosted Support
With the advent of Vigilia Self-Hosted, Wacnet needed to be able to send its recorded data to *any server*. 

It is now possible for Wacnet to send the recorded data to the same machine (localhost), a remote Vigilia server hosted by your company, or simply continue using HVAC.IO servers.
