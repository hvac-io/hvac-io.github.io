We just released a new version of Wacnet.

If you are on the mailing list, you should have received a direct
download link to the last compiled version.

For all the others, you can get it there: 
[Download Wacnet](https://hvac.io/docs/wacnet).


## Bug Fixes
- Vigilia device ID filter (NaN error when clearing the field);
- Now works in Java 9 (tested on Java Oracle and Openjdk);
- Some communication problems with other BACnet devices.

## Quality of Life Update

We tweaked things a little to make things more easy to use.

- Better error messages;
- Add multiple object selection capability;
- Drag and drop those objects into an external software (ie Excel);
- Much better object selection for Vigilia recordings;

Let us know if there is something else you'd like to see in Wacnet.

Enjoy!
