Hello folks,

We just released a new version of Wacnet.

You can download it here:
[Download Wacnet](https://hvac.io/docs/wacnet)

This version let the user configure a pause between each object in a network-wide scan.
(Used mostly for [Vigilia](https://hvac.io/services/vigilia))

We added this configuration because one of our customers was receiving alarms when running scans. Apparently, their workstation considered the device *dead* if it didn't answer in a very short time (less than a second).

The problem in this case was that some devices have many objects; scanning them was keeping the device busy for a couple second, thus triggering the alarms.

Cheers!
