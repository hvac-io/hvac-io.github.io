Howdy everyone!

Just a quick note to announce a new minor version of Wacnet.

You can download it here:
[Download Wacnet](https://hvac.io/docs/wacnet)

This version fixes a little bug that prevented the summary table to
show the objects unit.


## Video Tutorials

I've also taken the time to make a few short videos showing how to
start and configure Wacnet.

Let me know if there's something in particular you'd like me to cover
in the next videos.
