We just released a new version of Wacnet.

If you are on the mailing list, you should have received a direct
download link to the last compiled version.

For all the others, you can get it there: 
[Download Wacnet](https://hvac.io/docs/wacnet).


## Bug Fixes

We fixed quite a few communication bugs, mostly for old devices that
don't support segmentation.

We need to thank users like you for bringing those problems to our
attention. Please continue to do so, we'll gladly try to fix them ASAP
and make Wacnet better for everyone!


## Object List Pagination

In this release, we added the concept of pagination for the object
list (API). While it is considered bad practice in the BACnet world to
have hundreds (and even thousands) of objects, some manufacturers are
still doing it. The pagination allows to ask for a limited subset of
these.

The Explorer, which is a great demo of the API capabilities, has been
updated to use this new feature. Now, instead of loading the list of
all objects in a single request, it will load a few of them at the
time and add them incrementally in the user interface.

## BACnet Priority Array

In BACnet, some properties can have multiple "priorities". If you
write the `present-value` property with a proprity of 16 while the
`present-value` has a priority of 10, **your new value won't appear**!
This is because the current value has a higher priority and is the one
that is being returned when asked for the `present-value`.

The Wacnet API now supports adding a priority when writing to an
object.

While this new feature is powerful, you can easily cause havoc on a
BACnet network... we suggest you use the priority field only if you
know exactly what you are doing.

That's about it.

Enjoy!
