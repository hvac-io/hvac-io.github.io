Yes, we are still alive and kicking!
Just a quick post to let you know that we released a new version of Wacnet.

If you are on the mailing list, you should have received a direct download link to the last compiled version.

For all the others, you can get it there:
[Download Wacnet](https://hvac.io/docs/wacnet).

## Wacnet as BACnet Bridge for Web UI

Many improvements were added to allow displaying live data from a BACnet network in a simple webpage.
Most notably, the REPL API was improved to allow easier fetching of trend logs data.

Use your HTML, CSS, JS or even SVG skills to create a dashboard displaying live BACnet data:

## Vigilia

- Improved support for proxies;
- Logs are sent in another thread;
- More efficient scan algorithm;
- Better handling of network errors.


## BACnet

Finally, two notable improvements that should benefit all Wacnet users:

- More reliable read of remote BACnet objects;
- Added ability to create local objects via the API;

Enjoy!
